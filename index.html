            <p class="first-line">My name is Max Caulfield, and ever since I was a little kid I knew I wanted to be a
                photographer.</p>
            <p>I've always seen the world through my own lens finder. Maybe it's a way for me to be part of the world,
                but at a safe distance.</p>

            <p> For some reason I was always drawn to old analog camera gear rather than digital tech. I love all kinds
                of styles and techniques but for me, the instant camera selfie is the one I love most. I don't care if
                people make fun of me or not. I'm in great company, right? And now I've come all the way back to my
                childhood home to study photography at Blackwell Academy, a private school for 12th grade seniors. On a
                scholarship even!</p>

            <p> I originally left behind Chloe, my "best friend forever" (at least until I left without talking to her
                once in five years) and it feels so weird to be back here without seeing her yet. So I'm eighteen now,
                an official adult even though I don't always feel so wise or mature, and I'm ready to begin a whole new
                life here with retro camera at my side.</p>

            <p> "Say Cheese!"</p>

            <p class="first-line">My name is Chloe Price, but you can call me ðŸ–•</p>

            <p> I am an inmate at Blackwell Academy, currently serving a four year sentence for crimes against
                maternity. That would be my Mom, Joyce, who seems endlessly disappointed in me. </p>

            <p> Which, I get it. I'm no one's image of a perfect daughter. Or student. Or anything, really. But who the
                fuck wants to be perfect? I'm surrounded all day by so called "perfection" and it sucks ass. Other
                things that suck: Mom's new drill sergeant boyfriend David, how hard it is to buy weed around here,
                having no friends, hypocrites, country music, people who say "chillax", Dad being dead.</p>

            <p> It's been two years since he died in a car crash, and I still think about him all the time. I've even
                been having this weirdly lifelike dreams. Sometimes I think he's trying to tell me something. Other
                times I remember that he's feeding worms in a ditch right now and anything else is just a fairy tale to
                make myself feel better.</p>

            <p> At least I have two weapons to help me survive this shitberg town: the pen I use to tag any and
                everything I want, and my shining personality. If I work at it, maybe I can leave this place just a
                little less perfect than when I found it.</p>
